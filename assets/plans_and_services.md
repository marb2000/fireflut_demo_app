## International Roaming

International roaming is easy with Fireflutt Mobile plans!  Use your mobile device while traveling outside of the United States. Find out more on this page, or check out our International roaming site for rates and additional info.

Our plans are also international plans. Your phone just works when you arrive - No setup required. (With qualifying plans. Capable device required. Not for extended international use. Coverage not available in some areas).

**International Data**

While many plans provide international data, you can add an international data pass if you need more high-speed data.

If you're in a destination where international roaming is not included with your plan or international pass, you can still use calling and messaging services but data is turned off by default.


**Block International Roaming**

We offer options for blocking usage while traveling outside of USA. Only the Primary Account Holder can block this service on My Fireflutt Mobile or the Fireflutt Mobile app.

* **Block international roaming:** If you block all international roaming, you'll no longer be able to call, text, or use data for the selected line while roaming outside of [Your Country - e.g., the US]. You can still use Wi-Fi for calls and text; additional charges may apply.
* **Block charged international roaming:** If you block charged international roaming, you'll prevent your line from incurring any international data roaming charges in countries not included in your plan.
